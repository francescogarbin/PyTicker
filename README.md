# PyTicker
Growin' a GTK+3 Python mutiplatform desktop app for quickly tracking your own selections of stocks

## The Project 
PyTicker tracks and displays real-time-ish stock quotes
in a window on your Linux, MacOS and Windows desktop.

It is a desktop app I've started to develop to flex muscles on Python
in the month of September 2020, my "Python Month" in which I plan to
gather as much knowledge of Python and it's core technologies for
console, web and dektop apps.

## The Journey
September 1st, 2020: downloaded Python 3.8 on my Mac and Ubuntu machines.
I count on working on both environments. There is a minor setup overhead
which I plan to balance and mitigate with a mix of Bash scripting as well
as high-level IDEs. Python IDLE works great, it's already pretty effective
in testing out basic OOP concepts.

September 2nd, 2020: managed to grasp all Python basic concepts. Two sources
 of reference. The excellent book Thinking Python by Allen B. Downey and the
 amazing website RealPython.com provided a nice start. Still not clear
 about some class method decorations but not relevant for now. Basic data
 structures such as dict and list are ok. Should suffice.

## The Rationale

I am the Innovation Manager of a mid-tier company providing ERP-like 
solutions to the energy sector, spending most of my time managing staff,
clients and projects. I do presales too of course. I feel the responsibility
to constantly explore and learn new methods and technologies, so I started
this little project with the objective of grasping the most out of Python,
acquire the most possible knowledge with the idea of transferring part of
this experience to my staff.
